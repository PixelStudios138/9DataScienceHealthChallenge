This repository is going to be used for the data challenge in the Year 9 Data Science topic of Computing Tech.

## Week 1
### Part 1
Some examples of questions for the `athlete_events.csv` file are: "Does age affect the amount of medals won?" and "What is the average medal colour for men and women?"

### Part 2
My question for this project will be: "Does a person's age affect the likelihood of them smoking or drinking more than others?"

### Part 3
